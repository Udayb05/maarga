    <p style="font-family: monospace">  Our first step towards this Social sevice was "Plantation",this was oraganised on August 15th.<br>This event was conducted with association with SAKSHAM NGO.<br>
        It was primarily started in Chinthamani Taluk with different colleges and schools including private and government.We the volunteers raised awareness about plants and importance of trees.We provided plants and made the school children to plant & guided them about saving watering the plants as they can water the plants by washing their hands in the planted area so that water can be saved.This drastically imporves the asthetic appearance of the campus & also gives the fresh air.
